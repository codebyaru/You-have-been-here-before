 In a different reality lies the world of Aethernal.\
 It was not shaped by gods…\
but by beings known as the Architects.

They harnessed the forces of nature itself.\
Fire. Water. Stone. Wind. Shadow.\
 To protect the world, they sealed this power within mighty monsters.

 But one force could not be sealed.\
Too absolute. Too unstable.\
 So the Architects created a guardian…\
 one that could resist all magic.

The Architects vanished.\
 And the world grew colder.\
 As if waiting for something to break.

 In this winter lived Max.\
A swordsman who believed skill was enough.\
 For the first time…\
 he believed he had already won.

 Then one night…\
the storm did not sound natural.\
 And the world turned green.

 He fought.\
 Steel against something that could not bleed.\
 And in desperation…he  struck.

 You call this tragedy.\
I call it weakness.\
Deny it if you wish.\
You are their murderer.
